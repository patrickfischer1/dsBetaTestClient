\title{ds.asList.o calling aggregate function asListDS.o}
\usage{
ds.asList.o(x.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.name}{the name of the input object to be coerced to class
list. Must be specified in inverted commas e.g. x.name="input.object.name"}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new output variable. If this argument is set
to NULL, the name of the new variable is defaulted to <x.name>.list}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
argument is not specified the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or by default <x.name>.list
if the <newobj> argument is NULL) which is written to the serverside.
In addition, two validity messages are returned. The first confirms an output
object has been created, the second states its class. The way that {as.list}
coerces objects to list depends on the class of the object, but in general
the class of the output object should usually be 'list'
}
\description{
this function is based on the native R function {as.list}
}
\details{
See details of the native R function {as.list}.
Unlike most other class coercing functions the serverside function
that is called is an aggregate function rather than an assign function.
This is because the {datashield.assign} function in opal deals
specially with a created object (<newobj>) if it is of class list.
Reconfiguring the function as an aggregate function
works around this problem.

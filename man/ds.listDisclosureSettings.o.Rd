\description{
Lists current values for disclosure control filters in all Opal servers
}
\details{
This function lists out the current values of the four disclosure
filters in each of the Opal servers specified by datasources. Six filters can
currently be set: (1) nfilter.tab, the minimum non-zero cell count allowed in any cell
if a contingency table is to be returned. This applies to one dimensional and two
dimensional tables of counts tabulated across one or two factors and to tables
of a mean of a quantitative variable tabulated across a factor. Default usually set
to 3 but a value of 1 (no limit) may be necessary, particularly if low cell counts are highly
probable such as when working with rare diseases. Five is also a justifiable choice to replicate the
most common threshold rule imposed by data releasers worldwide; but it
should be recognised that many census providers are moving to ten - but the formal 
justification of thi is little more than 'it is safer' and everybody is scared of something going 
wrong - in practice it is very easy to get round any block and so it is debatable whether
the scientific cost outweighs the imposition of any threshold. (2)nfilter.subset,
the minimum non-zero count of observational units (typically individuals) in a
subset. Typically defaulted to 3. (3) nfilter.glm, the maximum number of parameters
in a regression model as a proportion of the sample size in a study. If a study has
1000 observational units (typically individuals) being used in a particular analysis
then if nfilter.glm is set to 0.37 (its default value) the maximum allowable
number of parameters in a model fitted to those data will be 370. This disclosure
filter protects against fitting overly saturated models which can be disclosive.
The choice of 0.37 is entirely arbitrary.
(4) nfilter.string, the maximum length of a string argument if that argument is to
be subject to testing of its length. Default value = 80. The aim of this nfilter
is to make it difficult for hackers to find a way to embed malicious code
in a valid string argument that is actively interpreted. (5) nfilter.stringShort
to be used when a string must be specified but that when valid that string
should be short. (6) nfilter.kNN applies to graphical plots based on working
with the k nearest neighbours of each point. nfilter.kNN specifies the minimum
allowable value for the number of nearest neighbours used, typically defaulted to 3

#WORKING EXAMPLES NOT PROVIDED (MULTIPLE OPALS AND R SESSIONS MAKE THIS DIFFICULT)
##Client-side function call to list current disclosure settings in all Opal servers
#ds.listDisclosureSettings.o()
#
##Equivalent call directly to server-side function to list current disclosure settings in all
##Opal servers not recommended unless you are experienced DataSHIELD user
#ds.look("listDisclosureSettingsDS.o()") 
#
##Call to client-side function and save output as an R object to refer to later
#current.DisclosureSettings<-ds.listDisclosureSettings.o()
##Interrogate ouput later
#current.DisclosureSettings[[1]]
#
#Restrict call to list disclosure settings only to the first, or second Opals
#ds.listDisclosureSettings.o(datasources=opals.em[1])
#ds.listDisclosureSettings.o(datasources=opals.em[2])

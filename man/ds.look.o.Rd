\usage{
ds.look.o(toAggregate = NULL, checks = FALSE, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{toAggregate}{a character string specifying the function call to be made(see above)}

\item{checks}{a Boolean object indicating whether optional checks are to be undertaken
in this instance only one check is specified - to check that a "toAggregate" expression
has been specified, nevertheless this is defaulted to FALSE to be consistent with other
functions and to save a small amount of time.}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the <datasources>
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
{ds.setDefaultOpals.o}. If the <datasources> is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]}
}
\value{
the output from the specified server side aggregate function to the client side
}
\description{
The function is a wrapper for the 'opal' package function 'datashield.aggregate'.
}
\details{
the function {ds.look.o} can be used to make a direct call to a server side'
aggregate function more simply than using the {datashield.aggregate} function.
The {ds.look.o} and {datashield.aggregate} functions are generally
only recommended for experienced developers. For example, the toAggregate argument has to
be expressed in the same form that the serverside function would usually expect from its
clientside pair. For example: ds.look.o("table1DDS(female)") works. But, if you express
this as ds.look.o("table1DDS('female')") it won't work because although when
you call this same function using its clientside function you write ds.table1D('female') 
the inverted commas are stripped off during processing by the clientside function so the
call to the serverside does not contain inverted commas. Apart from during development
work (e.g. before a clientside function has been written) it is almost always easier
and less error prone to call a serverside function using its client-side pair.
